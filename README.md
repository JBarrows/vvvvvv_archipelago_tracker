# Supported Features
- Door Cost (0-3)
- AP autotracking
- Area (Entrance) Randomizer
- Area Cost Randomizer

## Entrance Tracking
For each area there are 3 icons on the tracker to be used when Area Randomizer and/or Area Cost Randomizer are set:
1. Door cost
2. Destination (exit)
3. Note
#### 1. Door cost
Left click to cycle the costs of each door. These can be seen by trying to enter an area without the required trinkets. The color of the door does not change.
#### 2. Destination
Left click to cycle the color of the destination. If Area Cost Randomizer is *not* set, you should change the destination to match the door cost, otherwise, these can be filled in as you discover where each door leads. When you change one destination, it is recommended that you "swap" destinations with the corresponding door as well, assuming it is also undiscovered.
Undefined behavior will occur if you have multiple doors leading to the same location.
#### 3. Note
Toggles between '?' and a smiley face. This has *no effect* on the rest of the tracker, but can be used as a reminder which destinations have been confirmed.
